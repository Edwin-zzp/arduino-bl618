# Arduino core for the BouffaloLab chips
[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/strongwong/arduino-bl618?style=plastic)](https://github.com/strongwong/arduino-bl618/releases)

Now start to support BL616/8 chips, other chips to be developed later.

The first version can be compiled and run, but the repository is still in the process of development, most of the APIs are not yet adapted, welcome more people in the community to participate.

## Installing with Boards Manager

Currently it supports windows and is tested on windows. Other systems have not been tested yet.
Install the latest [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), 2.x or higher is recommended.
Start Arduino and add the package URL address to the development board manager. into "**File->Preferences->Additional Boards Manager URLs**".
Enter this URLï¼š`https://github.com/strongwong/arduino-bl618/releases/latest/download/package_bouffalolab_index.json`.

Open Boards Manager from  "**Tools->Board->Boards Manager**" menu; Find the bouffalolab boards and install bouffalolab platform (and don't forget to select your BL618G0 board from Tools->Board menu after installation).

## Build test

After the installation is complete and the correct board is selected, you can write a simple code test in Arduino, such as the following code that outputs "*Hello World*".

```c

#include <WiFi.h>

int button_gpio = 33;
int button_state = false;

// Change the WIFI ssid and WIFI password below to yours.
char *ssid     = "your-ssid";
char *password = "your-password";

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(2000000);
    delay(10);

    // set LED output
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
    // set input key SW3
    pinMode(button_gpio, INPUT_PULLUP);

    WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
    // Will try for about 10 seconds (20x 500ms)
    int tryDelay = 500;
    int numberOfTries = 20;

    while (true) {
        switch(WiFi.status()) {
            case WL_NO_SSID_AVAIL:
                Serial.println("[WiFi] SSID not found");
                break;
            case WL_CONNECT_FAILED:
                Serial.print("[WiFi] Failed - WiFi not connected! Reason: ");
                return;
                break;
            case WL_CONNECTION_LOST:
                Serial.println("[WiFi] Connection was lost");
                break;
            case WL_SCAN_COMPLETED:
                Serial.println("[WiFi] Scan is completed");
                break;
            case WL_DISCONNECTED:
                Serial.println("[WiFi] WiFi is disconnected");
                break;
            case WL_CONNECTED:
                Serial.println("[WiFi] WiFi is connected!");
                Serial.print("[WiFi] IP address: ");
                // Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
                return;
                break;
            default:
                Serial.print("[WiFi] WiFi Status: ");
                Serial.println(WiFi.status());
                break;
        }
        delay(tryDelay);

        if(numberOfTries <= 0){
          Serial.print("[WiFi] Failed to connect to WiFi!");
          // Use disconnect function to force stop trying to connect
          WiFi.disconnect();
          return;
        } else {
          numberOfTries--;
        }
    }

}

void loop() {

    button_state = digitalRead(button_gpio);
    if (button_state == LOW)
    {
        // Disconnect from WiFi
        Serial.println("[WiFi] Disconnecting from WiFi!");
        // This function will disconnect and turn off the WiFi (NVS WiFi data is kept)
        WiFi.disconnect();
        Serial.println("[WiFi] Disconnected from WiFi!");
        delay(1000);
    }

    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
    delay(1000);
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
    delay(1000);

}

```

After writing and clicking Verify, if it doesn't report an error it means the installation is working.
